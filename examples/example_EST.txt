Here, we will generate the virtual site parameters and angle
constraints required for simulating an estrogen molecules with a 5-fs
time step. In fact, the input files were used for our publication
Larsson et al. (20XX) XXXXX XX:XXX--XXX. This is a relatively complex
example that require the addition of new atom types and their
interactions, new dummy-mass atom types and associated parameters for
virtual site constructions, and angle constraints for -OH groups. To
make use of the native machinery in pdb2gmx for inserting dummy atoms
etc we create an rtp file from the estrogen topology file using
derive_params.py. The necessary files EST.top and EST.pdb are both
available in the EST folder.


1. MAKING A WORKING COPY OF THE FORCE FIELD

1.1 We first make a copy of the force field directory just in case we make a mistake.

  cp -R $GMXDATA/top/amber99sb-ildn.ff $GMXDATA/top/amber99sb-ildn-EST.ff


1.2 It is advisable to edit the description in forcefield.doc in the
new force field folder to distinguish it from the unaltered force
field when running pdb2gmx.


2. GETTING NEW ATOM TYPES AND INTERACTIONS

Since the hormone is made of atom types that are not present in the
force field we need to extract those atom types and their interaction
parameters, and add them to the force field files. We also add an rtp
file for our ligand to make sure pdb2gmx can generate all virtual site
constructions from our parameters, add dummy atoms in the right place,
etc.


2.1 Run python derive_params.py -r EST.rtp -rd -m EST.top

This will produce a list of the atom types and their interaction
types. The -r option will create the rtp-file EST.rtp based on the
contents in EST.itp, and with -rd the dihedral parameters will be
present in the rtp-file. The -m option will however replace the
complete dihedral parameters with macros, defined in the associated
file EST_macros.txt (filename derived from the rtp-output name). We do
the latter since grompp is quite limited in how long lines it can read
from a topology file, and a macro name is much shorter than up to 12
consecutive parameters in a row.


2.2 Copy the bonds and angles to their respective sections of ffbonded.itp.

The angle and dihedral output should fit the force field files without
modification. Note that we do not transfer dihedrals at this point,
since the parameters are present in the rtp-file that we have
created. They will enter the topology at the pdb2gmx stage. When using
rtp input, this is a safer way than to include dihedrals in the force
field, since some dihedrals have the same atom types but different
parameters (see e.g. different aminoacid side chains in some
biological force fields).


2.3 Copy the rtp-file to the force field and the macro definitions to ffbonded.itp

cp EST.rtp $GMXDATA/top/amber99sb-ildn-EST.ff
cat EST_macros.txt >> $GMXDATA/top/amber99sb-ildn-EST.ff/ffbonded.itp


2.4 Copy the new atom types to atomtypes.atp and ffnonbonded.itp.

The atom types and non-bonded parameters require a little editing
however. First, all the atom types in EST.top have zero mass, so we
need to change that before adding them to atomtypes.atp. Note that
most of the information is not relevant for atomtypes.atp. We add the
following to atomtypes.atp:


  ca       12.01000
  ha        1.00800
  oh       16.00000
  ho        1.00800
  c3       12.01000
  hc        1.00800
  h1        1.00800

Similarly, the atom numbers is undefined for the new atom types, but
are required for ffnonbonded.itp. Hence, we change the second column
in the output to the atom numbers. We also need to set the masses
right in the third column.

h1           1      1.0080  0.0000  A   2.47135e-01  6.56888e-02
c3           6     12.0100  0.0000  A   3.39967e-01  4.57730e-01
hc           1      1.0080  0.0000  A   2.64953e-01  6.56888e-02
oh           8     16.0000  0.0000  A   3.06647e-01  8.80314e-01
ha           1      1.0080  0.0000  A   2.59964e-01  6.27600e-02
ca           6     12.0100  0.0000  A   3.39967e-01  3.59824e-01
ho           1      1.0080  0.0000  A   0.00000e+00  0.00000e+00


2.5 Having set the atom numbers, we add the following to
ffnonbonded.itp:

  ca       6          12.01000  0.00000   A     3.39967e-01   3.59824e-01
  ha       1           1.00800  0.00000   A     2.59964e-01   6.27600e-02
  oh       8          16.00000  0.00000   A     3.06647e-01   8.80314e-01
  ho       1           1.00800  0.00000   A     0.00000e+00   0.00000e+00
  c3       6          12.01000  0.00000   A     3.39967e-01   4.57730e-01
  hc       1           1.00800  0.00000   A     2.64953e-01   6.56888e-02
  h1       1           1.00800  0.00000   A     2.47135e-01   6.56888e-02

3. GENERATING VIRTUAL SITE PARAMETERS AND ANGLE CONSTRAINTS

3.1 We can now run mkvsites.py to get the missing parameters:

  python <path-to>/mkvsites.py \
    -ff $GMXDATA/top/amber99sb-ildn.ff \
    -res EST \
    $GMXDATA/top/amber99sb-ildn.ff/EST.rtp

which will generate the following output:

  ### Vsite data to add to forcefield
  # Constraints (ffbonded.itp)
  MCH3_1  MCH3_1   2    0.092573
  MCH3_1  c3       2    0.167737
  # Angle constraints (ffbonded.itp)
  ca      ho       2    0.191101
  c3      ho       2    0.194790
  # Dummy masses (ffnonbonded.itp)
  MCH3_1  0   0.000000    0.00    A   0.0 0.0
  # Dummy masses (atomtypes.itp)
  MCH3_1    0.00000
  # Add to the .vsd file under the appropriate group
  c3      c3      MCH3_1

mkvsites.py finds the need for a new dummy atom type MCH3_1. Two such
dummy atoms will be connected to a c3 atom to make a virtual site
construction for a methyl group comprise of one central c3 atom and
three hydrogens.

This new dummy-atom construction does not exactly match constructs already
present in the force field (compare with the preceeding output
"Dummy-atom constructs in force field"), so we must add all parameters
and the new dummy atom to the force field. Note that we can name the
new dummy atom any way we want, but for pedagogical purposes we stick
with the suggested name.


3.2 Add the following constraints to the [ constraints ] section of ffbonded.itp:

  MCH3_1  MCH3_1   2    0.092573
  MCH3_1  c3       2    0.167737
  ca      ho       2    0.191101
  c3      ho       2    0.194790

The first two constraints connect dummy atoms with each other and with
the anchoring c3 atom. The last two constraints keep hydroxyl angles
constant, since these would otherwise yield too fast oscillations for
a 5-fs timestep.


3.3 Add the new dummy atom to atomtypes.itp

  MCH3_1    0.00000


3.5 Add the new dummy atom to ffnonbonded.itp
  MCH3_1  0   0.000000    0.00    A   0.0 0.0

Here, a zero mass is in fact correct.


3.5 Add to the following to aminoacids.vsd file in the [ CH3 ] section:

  c3      c3      MCH3_1

This will instruct pdb2gmx to make MCH3_1 dummy atoms for any c3-centered
methyl groups connected to a c3 anchor.


5. Run gmx pdb2gmx -f ... -vsite hydrogens, selecting your newly
edited force field, followed by editconf and other commands to prepare
your system. You will now be able to simulate estrogen using a 5 fs
time step. Just remember to use constraints to remove even faster
degrees of freedom.
